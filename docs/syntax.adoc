== Introduction

POCA is JavaScript/ECMAScript-like, but it's not the same. It has some
differences and even a few features that ECMAScript doesn't have.

This document shows the features of POCA. POCA is a very powerful scripting
language, that uses some of the concepts coming from ECMAScript, Lua, Squirrel,
Nasal, Python, and Perl. POCA supports object-oriented programming (OOP) in two
flavours (prototype-based and class-based), as well as functional programming
and procedural programming styles.

In POCA everything is an expression; there are no statements, so for example
something like

[source,javascript]
----
var a = scope {
  var b = 1;
  for (reg c = 0; c < 16; c++) {
    b += c + c
  };
  b;
};
----

and

[source,javascript]
----
var a = if (b < 1) {
          1
        } else if (b < 4){
          2
        } else {
          3
        };
----

is valid POCA code.

People familiar with other programming languages, especially scripting
languages such as JavaScript/ECMAScript in particular, are usually able to
learn POCA fairly quickly.

== Architecture

POCA uses a frame stack, infinite register, bytecode instruction set
architecture (ISA).

Unlike almost all other script interpreters, POCA is thread-safe and scalable
when called from multiple CPU threads. No special handling is required and the
threads can be scheduled concurrently. There is no global lock (GIL) on the g
interpreter or the x86 just in time (JIT) compiler execution engine. The only
limit to scalability is the single-threaded incremental and generational
garbage collector, which must block all bytecode interpreter threads and CPU
native code threads compiled by the JIT compiler before executing.

POCA's API design concept is more or less similar to Lua's. This means that
concepts like hash tables (hashes), meta tables (hash table events), vectors
(arrays), etc. exist here too.

== Overview

=== Imperative and structured

POCA supports structured programming in the style of C. POCA supports function
and block scoping with the keywords var, let and const. POCA requires explicit
semicolons, as automatic semicolon injection can introduce hard-to-detect bugs.
The only exception is that you can omit the last semicolon in a `function`,
`scope`, or `code` block.

As with C-like languages, control flow can be achieved using `while`, `for`,
`do` / `while`, `if` / `else`, and `switch` / `case` statements. Functions are
weakly typed and can accept and return any type. Unspecified arguments default
to undefined. In addition to `for`, POCA also supports `foreach`, which can
iterate over ranges (arrays).

=== Weakly typed

POCA, like ECMAScript/JavaScript, is weakly typed. This means that in most, but
not all cases, certain types are implicitly assigned based on the operation
being performed, avoiding some typical JavaScript/ECMAScript quirks.

=== Dynamic

POCA is dynamically typed. Thus, a type is associated with a concrete value and
not with an expression. POCA supports several ways to test the type of objects,
including duck typing.

=== Everything is an expression

In POCA, everything is an expression, even statements, declarations and
definitions. So the following code snippet is valid:

[source,javascript]
----
let a = scope{let b = 0; for(let c = 0; c < 6; c++){ b++ }; b; };
let bla = if(a != 0){ 1 }else{ a ? 2 : 3 };
----

POCA essentially maps the mathematical concept and expression of "something"
into a complete scripting language.

=== Scoping

POCA supports lexical scoping, meaning that a variable’s scope is determined by 
its position in the source code.

Variables declared with `var` are local-scoped; they are accessible only within 
the scope in  which they are declared and any nested scopes. This behavior is 
similar to JavaScript’s function-scoped variables declared with `var`. Such 
variables are stored in a local hash table and can be accessed from the current 
frame as well as all nested frames.

In contrast, variables declared with `let` and `const` are block-scoped. Unlike 
`var`, they are bound to the block in which they are declared, meaning their 
visibility and lifetime are limited to that block and any nested blocks. 
This behavior is similar to JavaScript’s block-scoped variables declared with 
`let` and `const`. These block-bound variables are 
**not stored in the function’s normal local variable hash table** (the structure 
used for `var` variables). Instead, they reside in 
**specialized fast-access frame variable storages** that are tied to the current 
execution frame. This design provides quick access to block-scoped variables and 
keeps them isolated per block. The engine manages these storages using a 
**display-list mechanism** (a structure that maintains a list of active lexical 
environments by nesting level), which allows nested blocks or inner functions to 
efficiently reference variables from their enclosing blocks, even beyond the 
immediate block context for closures. This is similar to how ECMAScript/JavaScript also
optimizes variable storage between registers and the stack, except that ECMAScript/JavaScript
uses environment objects for closures, while POCA uses a display-list mechanism based 
on a chain of context frames, where every frame can have its own display list.

This frame-based storage is utilized whenever a block-scoped variable needs to 
exist beyond the immediate block execution or be accessible from an inner scope. 
For example, if an inner function (closure) is defined inside a block and captures 
a `let`/`const` variable, that variable will be placed in the frame storage so the 
inner function can access it later. In such cases (or generally when the function 
contains any nested scopes), the compiler ensures the variable lives in the frame 
storage. On the other hand, if a block’s variables are *purely local* (used only 
within the block and not needed by any outside code or closures), POCA may optimize 
by keeping them in **registers** instead of in the frame storage. Using registers 
for strictly local variables avoids the overhead of managing an extra storage 
structure and yields faster access. In summary, `let` and `const` variables are 
confined to their block and kept out of the general local table, living either 
in a dedicated frame storage (when necessary for scope access or lifetime) or 
directly in registers for maximal performance in self-contained cases.

Example:

[source,javascript]
----
let a = 1;
const b = 2;
function Func1(){
  let c = 3;
  scope{
    let c = 4;
    puts(c);
  }
  // c is 3 here and not 4
  // because c is block-scoped
  // and not function-scoped
  var d = 4; // d is function-scoped 
  function Func2(){
    let e = 5;
    scope{
      let e = 6;
      puts(e);
    }
    // e is 5 here and not 6
    // because e is block-scoped
    // and not function-scoped
    return a + b + c + d + e;
  }
  Func2();
}
Func1();
----

This approach ensures that `let` and `const` variables occupy the specialized fast-access
frame variable storages only when necessary, reducing overhead, much like how
ECMAScript/JavaScript optimizes variable storage between registers and the stack.

POCA also supports closures, allowing functions to capture and remember the 
environment in which they were created, even if that environment is no longer in scope. 
This enables powerful programming techniques such as maintaining state or 
encapsulating private variables. Note that closures in POCA behave slightly differently 
from those in ECMAScript/JavaScript: in POCA, closures capture variables at the time 
the function is defined rather than when the block is exited. For example, consider 
the following code:

[source,javascript]
----
let a = 1;
let t = new Array();
for(let i = 0; i < 10; i++){
  let b = i;
  t.push(
    function(){
      return a + b + i;
    }
  );
}
for(let i = 0; i < 10; i++){
  puts(t[i]());
}
----

This code outputs:

[source,javascript]
----
20
20
20
20
20
20
20
20
20
20
----

Here, the variable `i` is captured when the function is defined, causing each closure 
to reference the same (final) value of `i`. In contrast, ECMAScript/JavaScript typically 
captures the variable when the block is exited. To create a closure that captures the 
current value of `i` in POCA, you can use an inline function to create a new scope:

[source,javascript]
----
let a = 1;
let t = new Array();
for(let i = 0; i < 10; i++){
  t.push(
    function(i){
      let b = i;
      return function(){
        return a + b + i;
      }
    }(i)
  );
}
for(let i = 0; i < 10; i++){
  puts(t[i]());
}
----

This code outputs:

[source,javascript]
----
1
3
5
7
9
11
13
15
17
19
----

In this case, the inline function creates a new scope that captures the current 
value of `i`, resulting in each closure maintaining its own copy of `i`. This 
behavior is similar to how closures are handled in Python, where variables are 
captured at function definition time.

Below is a Python script that demonstrates the "freeze effect" in closures, with 
print statements that refer to the POCA behavior:

[source,python]
----

# Without using default arguments:
# All closures refer to the final values of 'i' and 'b'.
a = 1
closures_without_freeze = []
for i in range(10):
    b = i
    closures_without_freeze.append(lambda: a + b + i)

print("Without freeze (no default arguments), like at POCA without inline function:")
for func in closures_without_freeze:
    # Since 'i' and 'b' end with the value 9, each call returns: 1 + 9 + 9 = 19.
    print(func())

# Using default arguments to capture (freeze) the current values at function definition time:
closures_with_freeze = []
for i in range(10):
    b = i
    # Here, 'i=i' and 'b=b' freeze the current values.
    closures_with_freeze.append(lambda i=i, b=b: a + b + i)

print("\nWith freeze (using default arguments), like at POCA with inline function:")
for func in closures_with_freeze:
    print(func())

### Explanation
#
# - **Without Freeze:**  
#   The closures are created without default arguments, so they capture `i` 
#   and `b` by reference. When the loop ends, both `i` and `b` have the final 
#   value of 9, and every closure returns the same result (19). This is analogous 
#   to POCA code that doesn’t use an inline function to create a new scope.
# 
# - **With Freeze:**  
#   Using default arguments (`i=i, b=b`), each lambda captures the current values 
#   of `i` and `b` at the time it is defined. This “freezes” the values, similar
#   to how an inline function in POCA creates a new scope, ensuring that each 
#   closure maintains its own copy of `i` and `b`.
# 
# This script clearly illustrates the difference in behavior between closures that 
# do not freeze variable values and those that do.

----

Finally, POCA supports the `scope` and `code` keywords to create explicit scopes. 
The `scope` keyword creates a new scope, while the `code` keyword creates a new 
code block without introducing a new scope. This provides additional control over 
variable visibility and lifetime.

== A quick tour

=== How to declare variables

[source,javascript]
----
var x;
let y;
----

=== How to use variables

[source,javascript]
----
x = 5;
y = 6;
let z = x + y;
----

=== Values

The POCA syntax defines two types of values:

* Fixed values
* Variable values

Fixed values are called Literals.

Variable values are called Variables.

=== Literals

The two most important syntax rules for fixed values are:

Numbers are written with or without decimals:

[source,javascript]
----
10.50

1001
----

Strings are text, written within double or single quotes:

[source,javascript]
----
"John Doe"

'John Doe'
----

=== Variables

In a programming language, variables are used to store data values.

POCA uses the keywords var, let and const to declare variables.

An equal sign is used to assign values to variables.

In this example, x is defined as a variable. Then, x is assigned (given) the value 6:

[source,javascript]
----
let x;
x = 6;

// or

let x = 6;
----

=== Operators

POCA uses arithmetic operators ( + - * / ) to compute values:

[source,javascript]
----
(5 + 6) * 10
----

POCA uses an assignment operator ( = ) to assign values to variables:

[source,javascript]
----
let x, y;
x = 5;
y = 6;
----

=== Expressions

An expression is a combination of values, variables, and operators, which computes to a value.

The computation is called an evaluation.

For example, 5 * 10 evaluates to 50:

[source,javascript]
----
5 * 10
----

Expressions can also contain variable values:

[source,javascript]
----
x * 10
----

The values can be of various types, such as numbers and strings.

For example, `"John" ~ " " ~ "Doe"`, evaluates to `"John Doe"`, since `~` is using for string concatenation:

[source,javascript]
----
"John" ~ " " ~ "Doe"
----

=== Keywords

POCA keywords are used to identify actions to be performed.

The `let` keyword is used to create variables:

[source,javascript]
----
let x = 5 + 6;
let y = x * 10;
----

The `var` keyword is also used to create variables:

[source,javascript]
----
var x = 5 + 6;
var y = x * 10;
----

However, the `const` keyword is also used to create constants:

[source,javascript]
----
const x = 5 + 6;
const y = x * 10;
----

=== Comments

Not all POCA statements are "executed".

Code after double slashes `//` or between

[source,javascript]
```
/*
```

and

[source,javascript]
```
*/
```

is treated as a comment.

Comments are ignored, and will not be executed:

[source,javascript]
----
let x = 5;   // I will be executed

// x = 6;   I will NOT be executed
----

=== Identifiers / Names

Identifiers are POCA names.

Identifiers are used to name variables and keywords, and functions.

The rules for legal names are the same in most programming languages.

A POCA name must begin with:

* A letter (A-Z or a-z)
* A dollar sign ($)
* Or an underscore (_)

Subsequent characters may be letters, digits, underscores, or dollar signs.

Numbers are not allowed as the first character in names.

This way POCA can easily distinguish identifiers from numbers.

=== POCA is Case Sensitive

All POCA identifiers are case sensitive.

The variables lastName and lastname, are two different variables:

[source,javascript]
----
let lastName = "Doe";
let lastname = "Peterson";
----

POCA does not interpret LET or Let as the keyword let.

=== POCA Character Set

POCA uses the Unicode character set together with the UTF8 internal encoding.

Unicode covers (almost) all the characters, punctuations, and symbols in the world.

== Learning by examples

=== Definitions

[source,javascript]
----
a = 3.14159;                    // a is then inside in the current environment hash table
var b = 0x10000;                // b is then inside in the current environment hash table
register c = 0b10101;           // c is then assigned to a VM-register
reg d = 0b10101;                // reg is a syndrom for register
let e = 0o77777;                // let is also a syndrom for register
const f = "This is a constant";

var (g, h) = (0, 1);
(g, h) = (h, g);

function bla(){
  return [1, 2, 3]:
}

let (x, y, z) = bla();
----

=== Scope and code blocks

POCA distinguishes between object/hash literals and code blocks based on their content. Object literals are defined by key-value pairs separated by colons (`:`) and commas (`,`). Code blocks consist of expressions or statements without this pattern. The `scope` and 'code' keywords can be used to explicitly define a code block when ambiguity might arise, as everything in POCA is treated as an expression.

[source,javascript]
----
// Example object literal with multiple keys
{ name: "Alice", age: 30 }

// Example object literal with a single key-value pair
{ Name: "Alice" }

// Example shorthand object literal
{ name, age } // Assuming 'name' and 'age' are defined variables, it expands to { name: name, age: age }

// Example object literal with a single shorthand key
{ name } // Assuming 'name' is defined, it expands to { name: name }

// Example code block
{ name; } // This is treated as a code block, because of the semicolon, for distinguishing it from an shorthand object literal

// Example code block
{ print("Hello"); }

// Explicit code block using 'scope' where a new scope is created
scope {
  let x = 10;
  print(x);
}

// Example code block using 'code' where no new scope is created
code {
  let y = 20;
  print(y);
}

// Example of nested code blocks with explicit 'scope' and 'code' keywords
scope {
  let a = 1 + 2;
  code {
    let b = a + 2;
    print(b);
  }
}

----

Without the `scope` and `code` keyword, POCA relies on the presence of key-value pairs (identifiers followed by a colon and value) to identify object literals. If no such pattern is found within the curly braces, it's treated as a code block. However, empty curly braces `{}` are always treated as an empty object literal, since inside code blocks, these are anyway effectively no-ops and will be garbage collected later.

This distinction allows for flexibility in defining both objects and code blocks, making POCA's syntax versatile.

=== Arrays/Vectors

[source,javascript]
----
let va = [1, 2, 3];
let vb = [4, 5, 6];
let vc = (va ~ vb) ~ [7, 8, 9];  // ~ is the concatenation operator for arrays, strings, etc.
let vd = vc[0 .. 4];             // range slice copy

va.push(21);
va.push(42);
va.push(1337);

for(let i = 0; i < va.size(); i++){
  puts(va[i]);
}

foreach(let arrayElement in vd){
  puts(arrayElement);
}

while(!va.empty()){
  va.pop();
}

function Bla(){
  return [1, 2, 3];
}

let (a, b, c) = Bla();

puts(a, " ", b, " ", c);
----

=== Hashs/Prototyping/Objects

[source,javascript]
----
let aHash = {
              bla: "bla!",
              bluh: "bluh?"
            };

foreach(let hashElement; aHash){
  puts(hashElement);
}

function oa(){
  return {};
}

var x = {a: 12, y:() => puts(@a)};
let y = {prototype: x, b: 34};
let z = {prototype: y, c: 56};
const p = {b: 42, "c": 41};
